          "description": "The code exhibits several vulnerabilities related to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration. Specifically, the use of a wildcard '*' for 'AllowOrigins' in conjunction with 'AllowCredentials' being set to true poses a significant security risk, as it allows any origin to access sensitive resources with credentials. This can lead to unauthorized access and data leakage. Additionally, the panic statements indicate a lack of graceful error handling, which could lead to application crashes under certain conditions. The code should ensure that 'AllowOrigins' is not set to '*' when 'AllowCredentials' is true, and implement proper error handling to avoid abrupt terminations."
