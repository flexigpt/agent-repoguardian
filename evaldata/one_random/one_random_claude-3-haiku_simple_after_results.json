          "vuln": true,
          "description": "The provided code has a potential security vulnerability related to the handling of the 'AllowOrigins' configuration. Specifically:\n\n1. If 'AllowCredentials' is set to true and 'AllowOrigins' is set to a wildcard ('*'), this can lead to a security vulnerability. The code correctly identifies this and throws a panic, which is a good mitigation.\n\n2. If 'AllowOriginsFunc' is not defined and 'AllowOrigins' contains invalid origin formats, the code logs a warning but still proceeds to use the invalid origins. This could potentially lead to unintended behavior and security issues if the invalid origins are not properly handled.\n\n3. The code does not properly validate the 'originHeader' value before using it to set the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header. If the 'originHeader' value is malformed or contains unexpected characters, it could lead to security vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\nTo address these vulnerabilities, the code should:\n- Thoroughly validate the 'originHeader' value before using it in the response headers.\n- Ensure that all 'AllowOrigins' values are properly normalized and validated before using them.\n- Consider adding more robust error handling and validation for the 'AllowOriginsFunc' configuration."

          "description": "The provided code does not appear to contain any obvious vulnerabilities. The functions are focused on validating and normalizing domain and origin information, which are common security practices. The code follows secure coding practices such as:\n\n1. Properly validating input using functions like `normalizeDomain()` and `normalizeOrigin()`.\n2. Avoiding the use of unsafe string operations like concatenation.\n3. Implementing domain matching logic that prevents common security issues like wildcard subdomain matching.\n\nOverall, the code seems to be well-designed and implemented with security in mind."
