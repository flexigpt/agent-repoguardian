          "description": "The provided code contains several areas that could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities, but none are directly exploitable based on the given code snippets. The main concerns are:\n\n1. **CORS Configuration Warning**: The log warning about both 'AllowOrigins' and 'AllowOriginsFunc' being defined (line: `log.Warn(\"[CORS] Both 'AllowOrigins' and 'AllowOriginsFunc' have been defined.\")`) suggests a potential misconfiguration. However, this is not directly exploitable unless further context is provided.\n\n2. **String Handling**: The use of `strings.ReplaceAll` and `strings.Split` for handling CORS origins (line: `allowOrigins := strings.Split(strings.ReplaceAll(cfg.AllowOrigins, \" \", \"\"), \",\")`) could lead to improper handling of origin strings if not properly validated. This is more of a code hardening suggestion rather than a direct vulnerability.\n\n3. **Data Validation**: The function `validateDomain` and `normalizeDomain` (lines: `func validateDomain(domain, pattern string) bool {` and `func normalizeDomain(input string) string {`) are responsible for domain validation and normalization. Without seeing their full implementation, it's unclear if they handle all edge cases, but no direct vulnerability is evident from the provided code.\n\nOverall, the code could benefit from improved validation and configuration management to prevent potential misconfigurations or misuse. However, based on the provided snippets, there are no directly exploitable vulnerabilities. The score of 4 reflects the potential for improvement rather than immediate risk."
