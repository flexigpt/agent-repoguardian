Specifically, the function `normalizeOrigin` does not account for internationalized domain names (IDNs) which can lead to security issues such as domain spoofing. The function assumes that the domain is in ASCII format and does not convert IDNs to their ASCII-compatible encoding (ACE) using Punycode. This oversight can allow malicious actors to bypass origin validation by using IDNs that visually resemble trusted domains. To mitigate this risk, the code should be updated to handle IDNs properly by converting them to Punycode before validation."
