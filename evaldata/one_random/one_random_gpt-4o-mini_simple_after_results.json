          "description": "The provided code contains a potential security vulnerability related to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration. Specifically, the following issues are present:\n\n1. **AllowCredentials with Wildcard Origins**: The code checks if `AllowCredentials` is set to true while `AllowOrigins` is set to a wildcard ('*'). This is a known security risk because it allows any origin to send credentials (like cookies or HTTP authentication) to the server, which can lead to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. The code correctly panics in this case, but it is crucial to ensure that this check is always enforced and that the configuration is not inadvertently set to this insecure state.\n\n2. **Dynamic Origin Evaluation**: The use of `AllowOriginsFunc` allows for dynamic evaluation of allowed origins. If this function is not implemented securely, it could allow unauthorized origins to access resources. The implementation of this function must be carefully reviewed to ensure it does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Invalid Origin Handling**: The code panics if an invalid origin is provided, which could lead to denial of service if an attacker can trigger this condition. Instead of panicking, it may be better to handle this more gracefully, such as by returning an error response without crashing the application.\n\n4. **Logging Sensitive Information**: The code logs warnings about invalid origins and insecure configurations. Care should be taken to ensure that sensitive information is not logged, as this could expose details about the server's configuration to potential attackers."

          "description": "The provided code has potential vulnerabilities related to domain validation and normalization. Specifically, the `validateDomain` function allows wildcard subdomain patterns but does not adequately prevent certain types of attacks, such as subdomain takeover or bypassing security restrictions. Additionally, the `normalizeOrigin` function does not handle cases where the origin might be malformed or contain unexpected components, which could lead to security issues if untrusted input is processed. Furthermore, the normalization process in `normalizeDomain` could be exploited if an attacker uses a domain with a scheme or port that is not properly handled, potentially leading to incorrect domain matching."
