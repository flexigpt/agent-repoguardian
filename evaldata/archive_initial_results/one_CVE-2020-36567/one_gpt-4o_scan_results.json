          "description": "The provided code contains a potential vulnerability related to the handling of time values. By truncating the latency value to the nearest second, precision is lost, which may lead to inaccurate measurements and potential issues in time-sensitive applications. Additionally, the code uses `fmt.Sprintf` to format log messages, which could be susceptible to format string vulnerabilities if user-controlled input is included in the parameters. It is crucial to ensure that all inputs to `fmt.Sprintf` are properly sanitized to prevent such vulnerabilities."

          "description": "The provided code contains several issues that could potentially lead to vulnerabilities:\n\n1. **Format String Vulnerability**: The `fmt.Sprintf` function is used to format log messages. If any of the parameters (`param.TimeStamp`, `param.StatusCode`, `param.Latency`, etc.) are derived from user input, this could lead to a format string vulnerability.\n\n2. **Unescaped Characters in Logs**: The log formatter includes unescaped terminal control characters (`\n`, `\b[97;42m`, etc.). If these log messages are viewed in a terminal, they could potentially be used to manipulate the terminal output, which could lead to security issues like log injection.\n\n3. **Hardcoded IP Addresses**: The code contains hardcoded IP addresses (`20.20.20.20`). If these IP addresses are placeholders for real user IP addresses, it could lead to privacy issues if the logs are not properly secured.\n\n4. **Improper Error Handling**: The code does not include any error handling mechanisms. For instance, `fmt.Sprintf` could fail or produce unintended results if the input parameters are not as expected.\n\n5. **Lack of Input Validation**: There is no validation on the input parameters used for logging. This could allow malicious input to be logged, potentially leading to log forging or other attacks.\n\n6. **Potential Information Disclosure**: Logging detailed information such as timestamps, status codes, latencies, and IP addresses without proper access control could lead to information disclosure.\n\nIt's recommended to validate and sanitize all inputs, handle errors appropriately, and consider the security implications of the logged information."

It could also lead to potential exposure of internal IP addresses.\n\n3. **Potential Information Disclosure**: The log formatter prints detailed information including timestamps, IP addresses, and HTTP methods, which can be useful for debugging but could also be exploited by attackers to gain insights into the application's behavior and structure.\n\n4. **Escape Sequence Injection**: The use of escape sequences like `\\x1b[97;42m` and `\\x1b[0m` could be exploited for terminal escape injection if the log output is viewed in a terminal that interprets these sequences."
