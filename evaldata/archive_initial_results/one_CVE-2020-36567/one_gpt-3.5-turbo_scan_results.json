The use of the format specifier '%#v' in the 'fmt.Sprintf' function call can lead to the printing of more information than intended. This is because the '%#v' format specifier in Go prints the value in Go syntax, which means it could print private struct members or other data not intended for logging.

Also, the changes in the assertions in the test functions are just to match the new format of the output string. There are no new functions or changes that manipulate data in an unsafe way."
