The code is primarily concerned with setting constants and checking if a domain string ends with a specific URL. There is no unsafe input handling, insecure database queries, or insecure network communication that could lead to vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or remote code execution. However, without the full context of the code, it's not possible to definitively say there are no vulnerabilities."
