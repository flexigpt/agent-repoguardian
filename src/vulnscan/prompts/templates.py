Task: Break down the provided code into logical, coherent functional blocks, and classify each block with the most relevant functional area labels from the provided list.

Instructions:

1. Identify Logical Functional Blocks:
- Review the provided code lines and group them into logical, coherent functional blocks based on their functionality.
- Each block should represent a self-contained set of operations or a single coherent task, reflecting the main functional purpose.
- **Avoid granular classification**â€”focus on capturing the functional essence of each block.

2. Ensure Functional Area Classification:
- Classify each block using the most relevant functional area tuple(s) from the provided list.
- Aim to cover the functional aspects thoroughly to facilitate deeper analysis in subsequent steps. Ensure that each block is classified in a way that highlights its core functionality, making it easier to assess its significance and potential implications.
- If a block is relevant to multiple functional areas, assign up to two tuples, ensuring that these reflect the primary functions of the block.

3. Exclude Non-Functional Code Lines:
- Skip lines such as braces, whitespace, newlines, or comments that do not contribute to defining a functional block.
- Focus only on code lines that are integral to the functionality.

Functional Area Labels: These are tuples, with the first item as the `primary_functional_area` and the second as the `sub_functional_area`. Only use the tuples provided in the list below:

VULN_SCAN_CODE_V4_BLOCK_ISSUE_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
Task: Analyze the provided code, tagged with relevant functional areas, to determine if any code vulnerabilities are present. Provide a vulnerability score associated with each detected issue.

# Analysis Steps and Instructions:

Step 1. Analyze Code Blocks for Security Vulnerabilities with respect to the Tagged Functional Areas:
- Focus **exclusively** on the provided code. Do **NOT** infer or speculate about missing code, external dependencies, or potential issues that are not explicitly shown in the provided code.
- Use the provided example issues related to the functional areas as guidance. However, only flag issues if they are **directly observable** in the provided code. If the code is partial or lacks context, do **NOT** treat the absence of information as a vulnerability.
- Evaluate the usage of functions, APIs, and data handling **as implemented in the code**. Do **NOT** speculate about how the code might be used or what it might interact with outside of the provided context.

Step 2. Apply  Constraints: Verify that the issue adheres to the following constraints:
- The issue is observed **explicitly** within the given code and **not** inferred from external dependencies, packages, modules, or libraries.
- The highlighted issue is **NOT** based on speculation about code that is **NOT** provided or discussed in the input.
- The issue is **NOT** related to the mere presence of an import or external module but is tied to the actual usage in the provided code that demonstrates a security risk.
- The issue does **NOT** involve general bad programming practices unless they present a clear, exploitable security risk.
- The issue is **NOT** a trivial recommendation or a non-issue.
- The issue does **NOT** involve missing error handling as a standalone concern unless it presents a direct security vulnerability.
- The issue is **NOT** based on missing elements (like content security policy) unless their absence is clearly evident in the provided code lines.

Step 3. Generate a Score and Brief Analysis of each issue:
- Assign a score between 1 and 10 to each issue based on the risk of causing a security incident. Lower scores indicate lower risk.
- Clearly identify if the highlighted issue is an exploitable vulnerability. If it is not exploitable or only a potential improvement, it should **NOT** be treated as a vulnerability.
- For each detected and verified issue, provide the exact code line where the issue is observed.
- Include a brief analysis explaining the potential risk, why it is a concern, and suggest possible mitigation strategies.

Step 4. Reverse Verification of Constraints and Output:
- Before finalizing and reporting any detected issue, check if any constraint is violated.
- If yes, reanalyze and reassess the issue.
- Determine whether it should still be flagged as a vulnerability based on the constraints and provided code.
- If you assign a score less than 5, carefully reassess whether the issue is genuinely exploitable or if it is more of a code hardening suggestion. Adjust the score if necessary.

Step 5. Report the Analysis:
- After verification, report the score, whether it is exploitable or not and the issue analysis in provided response format.
- Focus the analysis **ONLY** on detected issues. Do not discuss non-issues or code lines that are not vulnerable.
